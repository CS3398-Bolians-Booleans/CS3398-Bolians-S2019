# Predictive Automation Using Home Assistant
> A plugin for Home Assitant that track users and their smart device usage while they go about their daily lives within their home. Our plugin will then use Machine Learning to automate tasks the user typically preforms by scheduling them within Home Assitant.

## General info
Our plugin will help non-technical users tackle home automation. Home assistant has a tedious and diffucult to understand configuration processes for home automation. Our plugin simplifies the configuration process to be as minimal as possible. Our plugin will configure the scheduling of all smart devices in the home by tracking how the user normally utilizes them. The plugin then builds and maintains predictive schedules for the devices.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

* Machine Learning Code Made - Shaun
* Home Assitstant Server Set-Up - Stavros
* Documentation of API and Integrations Made (Foundation for Flask API) - Sherwin
* Created Initial Config for Device Tracking - Derek
* Edited Config File to work with Basic Integration - UnFinished - Patrick



To-do list:
* Implement Machine Learning algorithm
* Implement GPS and WiFi tracking
* Build Home Assistant Plugin

## Status
Project is: _in progress_ As it is still in the draft stage. 
* Machine Learning Code Working, next step to integrate with plugin - Shaun
* Hardware SetUp Complete, Add Additional Devices to Smart Network - Stavros
* Researched APIs for real-time data, Complete a pipeline for real-time dat - Sherwin
* Basic Plugin Completed, Build out functions for utilizing APIs, machine learning, and other plugins - Patrick
* Logging complete, Next build out multiple user action tracking - Derek 

## Retrospective
What Went Well or Maybe Not:
* Regulary Scheduled Meetings
* Maintained Frequent COmmunication
* Underestimated Workload
* Tasks Unclear
* Assumed Tasks Would be Straight-Forward
  * Shaun - Unclear in task assignment
  * Patrick - Unclear in understanding of task assigned
  * Sherwin - Unclear in task detail and implementation
  * Stavros - Completed Entire Task
  * Derek - Completed Task and assisted other group members


What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better:
* Lack of Familiarity and Experience With Home Assistant

What Can We do to Improve:
* In the future we will write out the plan by detailing out the expected results of the task, and how the task will be achieved.
  * Shaun - Will be more clear in expectation of direction of project - measured by documentation of expectations
  * Patrick - More frequent updates about progress of tasks-  measured by slack message progress reports
  * Stavros - Communicate better with team members - as measureable by reaching out to individual members for updates
  * Sherwin - Define tasks better - measureable with more detailed description
  * Derek - Should have been more clear in tasks already accomplished to avoid overlap - as measureable with updates in slack and github
